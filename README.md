# Testy

Streaming asynchronous test runner for TypeScript.  For small to medium sized projects, you mind find it to be useful, because it:

1. Has familiar `describe`/`it`
1. Has builtin TypeScript support
1. Starts quickly, streams results, and has pleasing default reporting

## Technical Goals

I wanted to experiment with a few things while building testy:

1. A richer, more structured, streaming JSON test output alternative to TAP.
1. Strongly typed tests and assertions expressed as data.
1. Decoupled front end (test construction), back end (test evaluation), and reporting.

I learned some interesting things while thinking about these things, and I've written more about each below.
